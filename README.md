## Summary

Upon rendering, a 600 by 600 window will appear. Within the bounds, 25 to 35 randomly sized and colored balls will spawn and begin to saunter around the world. The balls all have a different speed. When a ball makes contact with an edge of the world, the ball will bounce off the wall and continue it's journey within the generated world!
